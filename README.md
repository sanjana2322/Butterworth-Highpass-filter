**EXP 8 - Butterworth-Highpass-filter** = In the field of Image Processing, Butterworth Highpass Filter (BHPF) is used for image sharpening in the frequency domain. Image Sharpening is a technique to enhance the fine details and highlight the edges in a digital image. It removes low-frequency components from an image and preserves high-frequency components. This Butterworth highpass filter is the reverse operation of the Butterworth lowpass filter. Designing a Butterworth filter involves selecting the appropriate filter order and components, usually capacitors, to achieve the desired flatness in frequency response. A high-pass filter is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design. The specifications of BHPF are as follows: 1) Sampling rate of 3.5 kHz, 2) Pass band edge frequency of 1050 Hz, 3) Stop band edge frequency of 600Hz, 4) Pass band ripple of 1 dB, 5) Minimum stop band attenuation of 50 dB.
